**Depth First Search**

**Definition:**
- Used for traversing all vertices in a graph
- Traverse all paths between any two vertices in a graph
- Similar to tree definition, can use a stack or recursion

**Breadth First Search**

**Definition:**
- Used for traversing all vertices in a graph
- Find shortest path between two vertices in graph with equal and positive weights
- Similar to tree definition, uses a priority queue
